# Introduction
The original script that was presented at the 2023 Medical Simulation Hackathon is contained in the prototype folder and is prototype.py
I did all the coding for the project, but I cannot take all the credit as my other team members did basically everything else, from
sourcing the gifs, to coming up with the actual idea. I have decided to take this up as a bit of a Summer project to improve it past
its prototype phase, and eventually add the networking functionality we always wanted it to include.
